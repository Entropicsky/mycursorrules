# Project Notebook

## Overview
This notebook contains ongoing notes, useful information, and interesting findings about the CursorRules project. All information that should be preserved across agent sessions will be documented here.

## Project Observations
- Repository initialized with global.md and global_memory_bank.md files
- These files contain comprehensive agent collaboration rules and instructions for maintaining a memory bank
- The project is focused on establishing structured rules and documentation practices for AI agents
- We are following the agent_notes approach from global.md rather than the memory bank approach
- GitHub repository exists at https://github.com/Entropicsky/mycursorrules.git

## Useful Information
- global.md contains agent collaboration rules for project understanding, documentation, development methodology, code organization, quality assurance, and source code management
- global.md focuses on the agent_notes approach for documentation
- global_memory_bank.md contains an alternative approach with a focus on maintaining a comprehensive memory bank structure
- The agent_notes approach is simpler and more focused than the memory bank approach

## Technical Notes
- Documentation structure follows agent collaboration rules with agent_notes folder
- Both rule documents emphasize structured development methodology, thorough testing, and comprehensive documentation
- The agent_notes approach is designed to provide a simpler but effective documentation structure
- GitHub repository should be updated regularly with documentation changes

## Documentation Strategy
- Follow the agent_notes approach with three core files:
  - agentnotes.md: Critical information for agent sessions
  - project_checklist.md: Plan with steps, progress, and status
  - notebook.md: Record of useful project information
- Create additional documentation as needed in the agent_notes folder
- Technical specifications for new features should be stored in the agent_notes folder
- Focus on keeping documentation clear, concise, and up-to-date

## Questions to Explore
- Is the current project focused on implementing these rules, or are they guidelines for a different project?
- Should we implement both the agent_notes structure and the memory bank structure, or choose one approach?
- Are there any specific features or applications to be built based on these rules?

## Session Notes
### Session 1 - March 22, 2025
- Set up agent_notes folder and documentation structure
- Reviewed global.md and global_memory_bank.md files
- Identified that the project is focused on establishing structured rules for AI agents
- Updated GitHub repository with documentation changes
- Made decision to follow the agent_notes approach rather than the memory bank approach
- Updated global.md in the repository to reflect the latest version
