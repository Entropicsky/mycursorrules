# Project Notebook

## Overview
This notebook contains ongoing notes, useful information, and interesting findings about the CursorRules project. All information that should be preserved across agent sessions will be documented here.

## Project Observations
- Repository initialized with global.md and global_memory_bank.md files
- These files contain comprehensive agent collaboration rules and instructions for maintaining a memory bank
- The project appears to be focused on establishing structured rules and documentation practices for AI agents
- GitHub repository exists at https://github.com/Entropicsky/mycursorrules.git

## Useful Information
- global.md contains agent collaboration rules for project understanding, documentation, development methodology, code organization, quality assurance, and source code management
- global_memory_bank.md contains similar rules but with a focus on maintaining a comprehensive memory bank structure
- The memory bank structure includes core files such as projectbrief.md, productContext.md, activeContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, progress.md, and project_checklist.md

## Technical Notes
- Documentation structure follows agent collaboration rules with agent_notes folder
- Both rule documents emphasize structured development methodology, thorough testing, and comprehensive documentation
- Memory bank approach is designed to address agent memory limitations across sessions
- GitHub repository should be updated regularly with documentation changes

## Questions to Explore
- Is the current project focused on implementing these rules, or are they guidelines for a different project?
- Should we implement both the agent_notes structure and the memory bank structure, or choose one approach?
- Are there any specific features or applications to be built based on these rules?

## Session Notes
### Session 1 - [Current Date]
- Set up agent_notes folder and documentation structure
- Reviewed global.md and global_memory_bank.md files
- Identified that the project is focused on establishing structured rules for AI agents
- Prepared to update GitHub repository with documentation changes
