# Agent Notes

## Project Overview
This repository contains guidelines and documentation for the CursorRules project, which focuses on establishing structured rules and documentation practices for AI agents. The project aims to create a comprehensive framework for agent collaboration, memory management, and development methodology.

## Project Structure
- `.git/`: Git repository
- `global.md`: Comprehensive agent collaboration rules covering project understanding, documentation, development methodology, code organization, quality assurance, and source code management
- `global_memory_bank.md`: Similar rules with a focus on maintaining a comprehensive memory bank structure for agent memory across sessions
- `agent_notes/`: Folder containing project documentation
  - `agentnotes.md`: This file - critical information for agent sessions
  - `project_checklist.md`: Plan with steps, progress, and status
  - `notebook.md`: Record of useful project information

## User Preferences
- Documentation should be kept up-to-date
- Following structured development methodology
- Code should be well-organized and maintainable
- Both agent_notes and memory bank approaches may be relevant

## Documentation Approaches
Two primary documentation approaches are outlined in the project:

1. **Agent Notes Approach** (from global.md):
   - Focused on project-specific documentation
   - Structured around agentnotes.md, project_checklist.md, and notebook.md
   - Emphasizes continuous documentation updates

2. **Memory Bank Approach** (from global_memory_bank.md):
   - Designed to address agent memory limitations across sessions
   - More complex hierarchy of documentation files
   - Core files include projectbrief.md, productContext.md, activeContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, progress.md, and project_checklist.md

## Documentation Pointers
- For project plan and status: See `project_checklist.md`
- For interesting findings and notes: See `notebook.md`
- For agent collaboration rules: See `global.md`
- For memory bank structure: See `global_memory_bank.md`

## Development Approach
1. Begin with thorough codebase review
2. Create detailed technical specifications before implementation
3. Implement features incrementally with continuous testing
4. Perform self-review before marking tasks complete
5. Make regular checkpoint commits to preserve working states

## GitHub Repository
- GitHub Repository: https://github.com/Entropicsky/mycursorrules.git
- Regular updates should be made to keep documentation synchronized
